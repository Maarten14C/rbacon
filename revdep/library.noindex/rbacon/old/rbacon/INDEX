A.modelled              Calculate modelled 210Pb
AgesOfEvents            Event probabilities against calendar age
Bacon                   Main age-depth modelling function
Bacon.Age.d             Output all ages for a single depth.
Bacon.cleanup           Remove files made to produce the current core's
                        age-depth model.
Bacon.d.Age             Output all depths for a single age.
Bacon.hist              Calculate age distributions of depths.
Baconvergence           Test to identify poorly mixed MCMC runs.
accrate.age             Obtain estimated accumulation rates for any age
                        of a core.
accrate.age.ghost       Plot a core's accumulation rates against
                        calendar time.
accrate.depth           Obtain estimated accumulation rates as for any
                        depth of a core.
accrate.depth.ghost     Plot modelled accumulation rates against the
                        depths of a core.
add.dates               Add dates to age-depth plots
agedepth                Plot an age-depth model
agemodel.it             Extract one age-model iteration
bacon2clam              Translate Bacon .csv files to clam .csv files.
calib.plot              Plot the dates
calib.plumbacon.plot    Plot the dates
clam2bacon              Translate clam .csv files to Bacon .csv files.
draw.pbmodelled         Plot the 210Pb data
flux.age.ghost          Plot flux rates for proxies.
proxy.ghost             Proxies analysed along the depths of a core can
                        be plotted as 'proxy-ghost' graphs against
                        calendar time while taking into account
                        chronological uncertainties. Here darker grey
                        indicates more likely calendar ages for
                        specific proxy values.
rbacon                  rbacon
