<h2>Obtain estimated accumulation rates as for any depth of a core.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Obtain accumulation rates (in years per cm, so actually sedimentation times) as estimated by the MCMC iterations for any depth of a core.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>
accrate.depth(d, set = get("info"), cmyr = FALSE)
</pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table summary="R argblock">
<tr valign="top"><td><code>d</code></td>
<td>
<p>The depth for which accumulation rates need to be returned.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>set</code></td>
<td>
<p>Detailed information of the current run, stored within this session's memory as variable <code>info</code>.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>cmyr</code></td>
<td>
<p>Accumulation rates can be calculated in cm/year or year/cm. By default <code>cmyr=FALSE</code> and accumulation rates are calculated in year per cm.</p>
</td></tr>
</table>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>should take into account hiatuses
</p>
<p>Considering accumulation rates is crucial for age-depth modelling, and even more so if they are subsequently used for calculating proxy
influx values, or interpreted as proxy for environmental change such as carbon accumulation.
Bacon deals explicitly with accumulation rate and its variability through defining prior distributions.
This function obtains accumulation rates (in years per cm, so actually sedimentation times) as estimated by the MCMC iterations
for any depth of a core. Deals with only 1 depth at a time. See also <code>accrate.age</code>.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>all MCMC estimates of accumulation rate of the chosen depth.

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre>
## Not run: 
  Bacon(run=FALSE, coredir=tempfile())
  agedepth(yr.res=50, d.res=50, d.by=10)
  d20 &lt;- accrate.depth(20)
  hist(d20)
  d20 &lt;- accrate.depth(20, cmyr=TRUE) # to calculate accumulation rates in cm/yr
  mean(d20)

## End(Not run)
