<h2>Estimate spectral density at zero</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The spectral density at frequency zero is estimated by fitting a glm to
the low-frequency end of the periodogram.  <code>spectrum0(x)/length(x)</code>
estimates the variance of <code>mean(x)</code>.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>
spectrum0(x, max.freq = 0.5, order = 1, max.length = 200) 
</pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table summary="R argblock">
<tr valign="top"><td><code>x</code></td>
<td>
<p>A time series.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>max.freq</code></td>
<td>
<p>The glm is fitted on the frequency range (0, max.freq]</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>order</code></td>
<td>
<p>Order of the polynomial to fit to the periodogram.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>max.length</code></td>
<td>
<p>The data <code>x</code> is aggregated if necessary by
taking batch means so that the length of the series is less than
<code>max.length</code>.  If this is set to <code>NULL</code> no aggregation occurs.</p>
</td></tr>
</table>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The raw periodogram is calculated for the series <code>x</code> and a generalized
linear model with family <code>Gamma</code> and log link is fitted to
the periodogram.
</p>
<p>The linear predictor is a polynomial in terms of the frequency.  The
degree of the polynomial is determined by the parameter <code>order</code>.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A list with the following values
</p>
<table summary="R valueblock">
<tr valign="top"><td><code>spec</code></td>
<td>
<p>The predicted value of the spectral density at frequency zero.</p>
</td></tr>

<h3>Theory</h3>

<p>Heidelberger and Welch (1991) observed that the usual non-parametric
estimator of the spectral density, obtained by smoothing the periodogram,
is not appropriate for frequency zero.  They proposed an alternative
parametric method which consisted of fitting a linear model to the
log periodogram of the batched time series. Some technical problems 
with model fitting in their original proposal can be overcome by using
a generalized linear model.
</p>
<p>Batching of the data, originally proposed in order to save space, has the
side effect of flattening the spectral density and making a polynomial
fit more reasonable.  Fitting a polynomial of degree zero is equivalent
to using the &lsquo;batched means&rsquo; method.
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>The definition of the spectral density used here differs from that used by
<code>spec.pgram</code>. We consider the frequency range to be between 0 and 0.5,
not between 0 and <code>frequency(x)/2</code>.
</p>
<p>The model fitting may fail on chains with very high autocorrelation.
